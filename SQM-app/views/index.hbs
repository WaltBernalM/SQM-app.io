    <div class="mt-4" style="width: 70%;">
      <p>One of the main problems in most of the companies is the follow up and on-time registry and fidelity of the Supplier Corrective Actions. Most of the time, the record is made by hand of the SQE.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is one of the tasks that takes a lot of time for the SQE to be efficient enough.
      Big companies have developed their own implementation and solutions, commonly the OEM, Tier 1, and Electornic component manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our intention is to bring you with a simple solution, easy of access, and as secure as your own intranet for the follow up of your SQEs in the problems that your organization encounters so often in the trip of the continuous improvement.
