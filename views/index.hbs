      <p>One of the main problems in most of the companies is the follow up, on-time registry and fidelity of the Supplier Corrective Actions. Most of the time, the record is made by hand of the SQE.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is one of the tasks that takes a lot of time for the SQE to be efficient enough.
